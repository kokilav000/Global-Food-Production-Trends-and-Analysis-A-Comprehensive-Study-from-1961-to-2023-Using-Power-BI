Skills Required: Data Preprocessing Techniques

Project Description:

Introduction:

ABC Company undertook a comprehensive study of global food production trends from 1961 to 2023, leveraging Power BI for insightful visualizations. The analysis encompassed key agricultural commodities, revealing that total rice production amounted to 269 billion tonnes, while wheat production reached 282 billion tonnes. The study highlighted that tea production stood at 2 billion tonnes, with Africa emerging as the leading producer of green coffee. Additionally, the research underscored a steady rise in wheat, maize, and rice production over the years, with wheat showing the most significant increase.

The project also explored the production volumes of apples, avocados, bananas, and oranges by different regions, identifying Europe and Asia as significant contributors. Maize production demonstrated consistent growth, particularly from the late 1980s onward. The study further indicated that grapes had the highest total production among fruits at 43 billion tonnes, followed by apples, bananas, and oranges. This comprehensive analysis equips ABC Company with valuable insights to better understand global food production trends, aiding strategic decision-making in the agricultural sector.
